  This repository is for the Learning Analytics Micro-Masters course on Feature Engineering. This course is three weeks long, and there are three R Markdown files for each week. Please see the full course, hosted on edX, for more details. Each one of the R Markdown files is designed to work with a common dataset from the Open University <https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset#data>

This file provides a brief overview of the OULAD dataset; it describes the multiple files and features within each file. Also included are skimr functions that provide descriptive statistics of features within each dataset.
